## Game rules

The goal of the game is to get the lowest score possible.
At the start of a round, each player flips two cards.
After everyone has flipped, the host user goes first.
Once a player has flipped all their cards, every other player has one remaining turn.
After this turn, all every player's cards will be flipped over.
